## CLASS 23B PRACTICE REPO

This repo is to practice git. Let's use it to share code or any useful content by using the GitHub workflow. Feel free to create your own branches and to start experimenting.


> Everyone has *READ ONLY* access in the **MAIN** branch. I and Beka will have direct access to MAIN. We will be sharing files in MAIN (mainly homework and maybe python). If you want to make changes in MAIN branch or add files to the MAIN branch, you need to issue a Pull Request.

## Some rules:
  ```no-highlight
    1. Nobody cannot push to **MAIN** branch directly
    2. Require review from *Code Owners* for merging: 
            when you create a file in your branch, you are the code owner
            anyone who needs to make a change to your file, needs *your* approval in PR 
    3. Required number of approvals before merging: 1
    4. You can request to have a direct access to MAIN branch, but I think 
        working through PRs will be more practical
    5. We all are learning, so pls let me know if smth is not working as it is supposed to :).
```

Hopefully, this will be helpfull for everyone.
