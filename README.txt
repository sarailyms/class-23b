This repo is to practice git. Everyone has READ ONLY access 
in the MAIN branch. I and Beka will be sharing code here (mainly homework and maybe python).
If you want to make changes in MAIN branch or add files to the MAIN branch, you would 
have to issue a Pull Request.

Some rules:
    1. Nobody cannot push to MAIN branch directly (only me and Beka)
    2. Require review from Code Owners for merging 
    3. Required number of approvals before merging: 1
    4. You can request to have a direct access to MAIN branch, but I think 
        working through PRs will be more practical
    5. We all are learning, so pls let me know if smth is not working as it is supposed to :).

Hopefully, this will be helpfull for everyone.
