This repo is to practice git. Everyone has READ ONLY access 
<<<<<<< HEAD
in the MAIN branch. I and Beka will have direct access to MAIN. 
We will be sharing files in MAIN (mainly homework and maybe python).
If you want to make changes in MAIN branch or add files to the MAIN branch, 
you need to issue a Pull Request.

Some rules:
    1. Nobody cannot push to MAIN branch directly (only me and Beka)
    2. Require review from Code Owners for merging: 
            when you create a file in your branch, you are the code owner
            anyone who needs to make a change to your file, needs your approval in PR

    3. Required number of approvals before merging: 1
    4. You can request to have a direct access to MAIN branch, but I think 
        working through PRs will be more practical
    5. We all are learning, so pls let me know if smth is not working as it is supposed to :).

Hopefully, this will be helpfull for everyone.
