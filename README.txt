This repo is to practice git for us. Everyone has READ ONLY access 
in the MAIN branch. I and Beka will be sharing code here (mainly homework and maybe python).
If you want to make changes to the MAIN branch files, you would have to create a branch 
and issue a Pull Request.

Hopefully, this will be helpfull for everyone.
